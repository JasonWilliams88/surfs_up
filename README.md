# __surfs_up__
Using a local database and SQLAlchemy, historical weather data will be parsed to determine the viability of a surf shop. This analysis only looks at the temperature.

- Based on the standard deviation, temperature in June is a more stable when compared with December
- December has less data points than June while having more days.
- The mean temperature is about even. 


## Summary
Overall temperature between the two months seemg about even and would be agreeable for a surf shop. December will have a few days that might be too cold and might result in fewer customers.

Due to December being a little more varied as far as temperature goes, a bar graph can be made to determine if the variability falls within a certain time of the month. Might help decide if its worthwhile to keep open those days.

Precipitation will also need to be analyzed. Even if the temperature is agreeable rain might put a damper on the surfing fun.
